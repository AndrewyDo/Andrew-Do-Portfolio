                <p>I am currently a full-time student at Loyola University Chicago majoring in computer science. My expected graduation date is December of 2024. I have been working as a technology trainer for Compudopt where I gain the opportunity to empower individuals in technology, both hardware and software, and making it accessible for all. I am passionate in programming and would like to continue my tech journey by delving into the realm of software engineering. I have taken many relevant courses as well as independent cources which help assist my computer science degree. I also have a few projects I have been working on which you can explore on this website. </p>

            <!-- Project 1 -->
            <div class="project">
                <h3>Health Tracker</h3>
                <p>As an integral part of the Health Tracker application, I developed the initial framework for the social engagement features. This feature allows for a user community through an interactive forum that encourages dialogue and health-related insights. In terms of future development, there will be the addition of a competitive yet collaborative environment where users will be able to partake in health challenges, tracking  daily foot steps and working towards a target BMI. Completion of these challenges will result in users with digital achievements, adding an element of gamification to encourage user engagement.</p>

            <!-- Project 2 -->
            <div class="project">
                <h3>Landfall</h3>
                <p>In the rpg based game Landfall, players command a PMC, accepting contracts and engaging in tactical combat. My role includes designing gameplay mechanics such as movement and programming the game's core functions. Current features enable player movement and basic enemy interactions within a Pygame environment. The game's objective is in the format of a reputation-based contract system, skill progression, and an cpu that challenges the player. Higher reputation will grant you more and higher stake contracts in order to receive more reputation and cash which you will be able to use to upgrade your player. In the end, it will be a fully immersive strategic game.</p>
