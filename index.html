                <h1> About Me </h1>
                <p>I am currently a full-time student at Loyola University Chicago majoring in computer science. My expected graduation date is December of 2024. I have been working as a technology trainer for Compudopt where I gain the opportunity to empower individuals in technology, both hardware and software, and making it accessible for all. I am passionate in programming and would like to continue my tech journey by delving into the realm of software engineering. I have taken many relevant courses as well as independent cources which help assist my computer science degree. I also have a few projects I have been working on which you can explore on this website. </p>
