                <p class="desc">I am currently a full-time student at Loyola University Chicago majoring in computer science. My expected graduation date is December of 2024. I have been working as a technology trainer for Compudopt where I gained the opportunity to empower individuals in technology, both hardware and software, and making it accessible for all. I am passionate in programming and would like to continue my tech journey by delving into the realm of software engineering. I have taken many relevant courses as well as independent cources which help assist my computer science degree. I also have a few projects I have been working on which you can explore on this website. </p>

                <h3>Health Tracker</h3>
                <p>As an integral part of the "Health Tracker" application, I developed the initial framework for the social engagement features. This feature allows for a user community through an interactive forum that encourages dialogue and health-related insights. The addition of a competitive yet collaborative environment where users are able to partake in health challenges which includes tracking daily steps and working towards a target BMI. Completion of these challenges will result in users with digital achievements, adding an element of gamification to encourage user engagement. To enhance security and usability, Firebase was implemented into the project for user authentication.</p>

                <h3>Landfall</h3>
                <p>In "Landfall," an RPG that allows players into the role of a Private Military Company (PMC), you navigate varying difficult battles and manage contracts. My contributions focus on developing core gameplay mechanics—specifically, player movement and enemy interactions within a Pygame framework (Python). The game revolves around a reputation-based system where skill upgrades and encounters with hostile CPU-controlled adversaries shape the player's journey. Advancing through the game, players earn a higher reputation and greater financial rewards, which can be used to enhance their capabilities. Ultimately, "Landfall" offers a unique, strategic experience as players climb the ranks in this immersive world.</p>

                <h3>Forth Project</h3>
                <p>We are currently developing a C-based interpreter for the Forth programming language. As of now, I have focused on implementing and manipulating variables which involves designing a comprehensive system that allows the interpreter to recognize and process variable tokens from user inputs. We also plan to add additional support for functions and the "REPL" of Forth. This project has been a crucial step in my understanding of low-level programming.</p>
